        The elk (Cervus canadensis), also known as the wapiti, is one of the largest species within 
        the deer family, Cervidae, and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in its native range of
        North America, as well as Central and East Asia. The common name elk, used in North America,
        creates confusion because the larger Alces alces, which is called moose in North America, 
        is also called elk in British English, and related names in other European languages 
        (German Elch, Swedish älg, and French élan). The name "wapiti" is sometimes used in
        North America for Cervus canadensis. It originates from the Shawnee and Cree word waapiti
        meaning 'white rump'.
